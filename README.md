Procedure:

1	: File arrives in the email
2	: File needs to be checked whether it is already in the library or not
3a	: When yes, a quality comparisson is made > if new file is better, old file is replaced. Work done.
3b	: When no, file will be opened in Acrobat X

4	: File is being checked for false copyright claims and website referrals which will be removed. This is done manually and copyright claims and website referrals are being removed manually, even in a 250 page file.
5	: File is then being sanitized so there is no trace of malicious scripts, links and other garbage
6	: The first page of the document is extracted as an image for later use
7	: When possible, OCR is applied
8	: File is being sent to smallpdf.com for compression, since that works better than Adobe X i think.

9	: File returns on the workstation and is being renamed.
		workshop manuals will be "workshopmanual-MODEL_YEAR_LANGUAGE_EXTRAS_DATE-TODAY_CURRENT-TIME" I am using the date of today and the current time to create a random, yet traceable library number.
10	: I open the library software on my website and upload all the files to the server
11	: I upload a copy to my backup server
12	: I manually rename all the files so they produce proper titles like "Workshop Manual for Honda XL50S (1976)
13	: Then I need to open each submitted file on the website to add a short description
14	: Then I upload the first page of each file to each submitted file in the library
15	: For each file, I create tags and keywords
16	: Finally, I make a post on the website, announcing the new files
17	: In the post, I create direct links to the files, so they can be downloaded right away
